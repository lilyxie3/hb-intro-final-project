Final Project - Blackjack

1. Player (you) vs. Dealer (computer)
2. Cards are dealt from either one or two decks. We will be using a single deck in this game.
3. Both you and the dealer are dealt two cards. The dealer shows his/her first card.
4. You get your score by adding up the values of your cards, or hand.
5. Every number card's value is its number, and any face card equals 10, Ace is worth 11 or 1, whichever is most beneficial for the player. 
6. The higher hand value not exceeding 21 wins. Any score over 21 is a bust (busted player loses, both bust -- no winner). 
7. If player has an ace and a ten-value card, then player has a blackjack
8. After receiving the initial two cards, player has the option to hit or stand. Hit means deaw one more card. Stand means no more cards.
10. Once player stands, dealer plays. the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher.
11. Equal score is a push, or a draw (no winner)
