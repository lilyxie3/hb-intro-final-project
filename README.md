Final Project - Blackjack

1. Player (you) vs. Dealer (computer)
2. Cards are dealt from either one or two decks. We will be using a single deck in this game.
3. Both you and the dealer are dealt two cards. The dealer shows his/her first card.
4. You get your score by adding up the values of your cards, or hand.
5. J, Q, K = 10, Ace = 11 or 1, whichever is most beneficial for the player. Rest of the cards has their face values 2 - 10
6. The higher hand value not exceeding 21 wins. Any score over 21 is a bust (busted player loses, both bust -- no winner)
7. If player has an ace and a ten-value card, then player has a blackjack
8. If player has a total value between 18 - 21, player should stand (no more cards)
9. If player has a total value less than 18, player should hit (draw one more card at a time)
10. Once player stands, dealer plays. the dealer's hand is resolved by drawing cards until the hand busts or achieves a value of 17 or higher.
11. Equal score is a push, or a draw (no winner)
