Final Project - Blackjack

# ace 11 or 1 
# J, Q, K are 10
# the rest of the cards 2 - 10 are face value
# you start with two cards and add them up
# if you have 21, then you have the best score, a blackjack
# if you have between 18 and 21, you should stand (no more cards)
# if you have less then 18, you can hit (one more card at a time)
# once you stand the computer plays
# the better score not exceeding 21 wins
# equal scores is a draw (no winner)
# any score over 21 is a bust (busted player loses, both bust --> no winner)
